# ML Agents Project - Final Version

This project showcases a robot agent navigating a 2D maze in Unity, using reinforcement learning to handle static walls and dynamic obstacles. The agent, represented by a 3D droid model, learns to navigate through exploration and reward-based feedback. Key features include a custom reward system, dynamic obstacles, and various hyperparameter experiments to optimize performance. Despite initial challenges with reward exploitation, the refined system successfully demonstrated effective navigation and decision-making.
